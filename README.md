<h1>Singapore Waste Management Analysis</h1>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
Singapore is on a mission to become a zero-waste nation, as the government is increasingly concerned about the rising levels of waste disposal. At the current pace, the Semakau Landfill is projected to run out of space by 2035, which is a significant challenge for the nation (source: Towards Zero Waste).

The government aims to inspire citizens by demonstrating the total energy saved through recycling efforts each year. This project analyzes Singapore's recycling statistics from 2003 to 2020 and calculates energy saved for five waste types:

● Plastics<br>
● Paper<br>
● Glass<br>
● Ferrous Metals<br>
● Non-Ferrous Metals<br>

<h4>Data Overview</h4>

| Material          | Energy Saved (kWh) | Crude Oil Saved (Barrels) |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **Plastic**        | 5774 kWh          | 16 barrels                |
| **Glass**          | 42 kWh            | 0.12 barrels              |
| **Ferrous Metal**  | 642 kWh           | 1.8 barrels               |
| **Non-Ferrous Metal** | 14000 kWh      | 40 barrels                |
| **Paper**          | 4100 kWh          | 11 barrels                |

> 1 barrel of oil ≈ 159 liters

<h4>Datasets<h4>
1. waste_energy_stat.csv: Contains energy and crude oil saved for each waste type per metric tonne.<br>
2. 2003_2017_waste.csv: Waste management data from 2003 to 2017.<br>
3. 2018_2020_waste.csv: Waste management data from 2018 to 2020.<br>

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:  

    ```bash
    git clone repository_url
    cd repository_name
    ```

2. Install dependencies:  

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and visualizations.


<h4>Usage<h4>
1. Ensure the datasets (waste_energy_stat.csv, 2003_2017_waste.csv, and 2018_2020_waste.csv) are in the project directory.<br>
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (singapore_energy.ipynb).<br>
3. Run all cells to calculate yearly energy savings and explore the visualizations.<br>

<h4>Visualizations<h4>
The project includes the following interactive visualizations:<br>

● Bar Charts: Showcasing energy savings per waste type across the years.<br>
● Line Graphs: Highlighting trends in recycling rates.<br>
● Stacked Charts: Comparing the contribution of different waste types to energy savings.<br>
